This is a minor release with the following changes:

## Fixes

- CI: container images built from tagged commits should now be automatically published.

## Improvements

- Switch to a distroless base container image (part of [#9](https://github.com/hackfixme/disco/issues/9)). This improves security and reduces the image size from ~140MB to ~20MB.
- Improve container-based workflow for increased security, and add [documentation](https://github.com/hackfixme/disco/blob/v0.1.1/docs/container.md).
